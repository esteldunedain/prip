**PRip** is a tool for digitizing scientific plots and graphs, getting numeric data. It works in a similar way to the popular g3data, but has a greater enphasis on usability and portability.

PRip is written in Python, and used the Qt toolkit through the PyQt bindings. This language and toolkit selection makes it hopefully very portable.

PRip is entirely **open-source**, and everyone is free to propose changes or maintain their own, customized version as long as they make their changes open to the public in accordance with the GNU General Public License (for more information check the license file attached to this project).

### Current Features
*   Import plots captured on typical image formats (jpg, png, etc).
*   Define reference points for x and y axis.
*   Digitize data using the free zoom view, which allow fast input and great precision.
*   Drag data points to improve the fit.
*   Export data as plain text.
*   Store the digitizing project for latter review or improvement.

### Planned Features
*   Digitize multiple datasets per plot and manage them.
*   Export gnuplot input to automatically recreate original plot digitaly.
*   Additional reference points for more accurate results on baddly digitized plots.

### Running
To run PRip you need to install the python interpreter and the PyQt bindings.

It is currently tested on Python 2.7.2 and PyQt 4.8.6, but should run on other versions of Python 2.* and PyQt 4.* as well.

#### On Windows
- Download the source code
- Install the latest version of python 2 from https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Install the corresponding version of PyQt from http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download
- Double click on the `PRip.py` file

#### On Ubuntu/Mint/Debian
If you have a distribution based on KDE you most likely already have whats needed. In any case, this instructions should :

- Download the source code
- `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python-qt4`
- On the source code, run `python PRip.py`

Or, if you want to automatically download and execute the latest code, installing dependencies if needed:

- `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git python-qt4 && git clone https://github.com/esteldunedain/prip.git && cd prip && python PRip.py`
